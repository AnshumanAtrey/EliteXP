## 👥 Team & Branching Strategy
- **Vijaye Kota**
- **Vamshi Shetty**
- **Sayuj Pillai**
- **Anshuman Atrey**

### Branching Recommendation
> To streamline development, create four branches named after each team member:
> - `vijaye`
> - `vamshi`
> - `sayuj`
> - `atrey`
>
> Each member should work on their assigned features in their branch. Merge to `main` via pull requests after code review. Document your part in your branch's README section as needed.
